# Palmyra_med_sepsis_app
 This is the repository for a research project concerning building LLM-RAG-based apps
## Overview
The repository contains files with persisting ChromaDB vector stores used for the functioning of an RAG-based software application that uses elements of a [multi-agentic approach](https://www.crewai.com/).
## The software applications for decision-making at an early stage of sepsis
The application requires input of information about a particular sepsis case as a clinical vignette. By pressing respective buttons on the application GUI, the user will get 
* *literature-based recommendations* concerning case management,
* *antibiotic recommendations*
* a *statement concerning the compliance of the generated recommendations with current sepsis guidelines*.
### Availability
For experimenting with the application can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/spaces/viapascurta/N_S_P_med. 
By activating the **How to Use the Application** button on the upper horizontal menu, the user gets detailed instructions on how to use the application.
