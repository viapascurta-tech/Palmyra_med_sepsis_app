# Palmyra_med_sepsis_app
 This is the repository for a research project concerning building LLM-RAG-based applications.
## Overview
The repository contains files with persisting ChromaDB vector stores used for the functioning of a RAG-based software application that uses elements of a [multi-agentic approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10537).
## The software applications for decision-making at an early stage of sepsis
The application requires input of information about a particular sepsis case as a clinical vignette. By pressing respective buttons on the application GUI, the user will get 
* *literature-based recommendations* concerning the management of a particular sepsis case at an early stage (e.g., before culture results are available)
* *antibiotic recommendations*
* a *statement concerning the compliance of the generated recommendations with current sepsis guidelines*

The application is built using [Shiny for Python package](https://shiny.posit.co/py/), and the inference engine is [Palmyra-med 70B LLM](https://writer.com/blog/palmyra-med-fin-models/) hosted on [NVIDIA platform](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover).

### Availability
To experiment with the application, you can build the application on your machine (the code is available in *app.py*) or by accessing the cloud version of it (this version uses GPT-3.5-turbo as an inference engine) at https://huggingface.co/spaces/viapascurta/N_S_P_med. 
By activating the **How to Use the Application** button on the upper horizontal menu, the user gets instructions on how to use the application.
